Warning: Value for undeclared variable

The root module does not declare a variable named "db_port" but a value was
found in file "terraform.tfvars". If you meant to use this value, add a
"variable" block to the configuration.

To silence these warnings, use TF_VAR_... environment variables to provide
certain "global" settings to all configurations in your organization. To
reduce the verbosity of these warnings, use the -compact-warnings option.
